<h3>Project description</h3>

- The dataset I chose is the affairs dataset that comes with Statsmodels. It
was derived from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook magazine, in
which married women were asked about their participation in extramarital
affairs. More information about the study is available in a 1978 paper from
the Journal of Political Economy.

<h3> Description of Variables </h3>

 - The dataset contains 6366 observations of 9 variables:

 - <b>rate_marriage</b>: woman's rating of her marriage <i>(1 = very poor, 5 =
very good)</i>
- <b>age</b>: woman's age
- <b>yrs_married</b>: number of years married
- children: number of children

- <b>religious</b>: woman's rating of how religious she is <i>(1 = not religious, 4 =
strongly religious)</i>

- <b>educ</b>: level of education <i>(9 = grade school, 12 = high school, 14 =
some college, 16 = college graduate, 17 = some graduate school, 20
= advanced degree)</i>

 - <b>occupation</b>: woman's occupation <i>(1 = student, 2 = farming/semi-
skilled/unskilled, 3 = "white collar", 4 =
teacher/nurse/writer/technician/skilled, 5 = managerial/business, 6 =
professional with advanced degree)</i>

- <b>occupation_husb</b>: husband's occupation (same coding as above)

- <b>affairs</b>: time spent in extra-marital affairs
